# Deep-Learning
self-taught

"Deep Learning" = Machine learinng + High level abstraction + Network

## What will be learned
1. Convolution Neural Network


## 1. CNN
Input -> Convoutions -> C1 Feature maps -> Subsampling -> S1 Feature maps -> Convolutions -> C2 -> ....

### Convolution + Subsampling => Feature extraction
#### 1. convolution
: filter(matrix) is learned -> how similar

- Zero padding: making edge of the convolution '0' 

2) Fully connected layer => Classifies category
